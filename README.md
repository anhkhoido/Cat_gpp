# Cat_gpp
Basic layout of a C++ class that is valid with G++. The class, which is a cat, follows the basic rule of C++ by encompassing
a safe constructor, an overloading constructor, a destructor, a copy constructor, an assignment operator, a move copy constructor
and a move assignment operator. All in all, this is a basic layout of a class that will be validated by Linux upon
receiving this command: "g++ -std=c++0x -o nameOfMyExecutable *.cpp".
